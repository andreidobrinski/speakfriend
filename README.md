### Elm

Right now we are experimenting with building the first few stages of our project in Elm. While our `package.json` file should take care of installing Elm for you, you may have to install elm globally.

```sh
npm install --global elm elm-live
```

Now you should be able to run elm. This may ask you to install other dependencies when you first run `npm run dev`
