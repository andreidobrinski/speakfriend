# Setting up the repo

There are three parts to our application right now:

**Client**: This is the front end. It is written in Preact. It uses webpack under the hood of Preact-CLI.

**Api**: Our api is served by POST**GREST**.

**DB**: Our db is in Postgres.

Let's install our stack!

1. [Download and install postgrest](https://postgrest.com/en/v4.1/install.html) (< instructions on the page linked )
2. Move the downloaded binary of _postgrest_ into the root of our project folder
3. Install our dependencies

```sh
make install
```

4. Run the entire stack

```
make start
```

Note: you can run each part of the stack independently; for example, start the client with:

```sh
npm run start-client
```
