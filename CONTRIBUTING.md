## Project setup

TODO

## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the [all contributors][all-contributors] specification. To add yourself to the table of
contributors on the README.md, please use the automated script as part of your PR:

```console
npm start "contributors.add <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>"
```

Follow the prompt. If you've already added yourself to the list and are making a
new type of contribution, you can run it again and select the added contribution
type. If you need to edit the `.all-contributorsrc` file by hand that's fine
too, just run `npm start contributors.generate` to regenerate the table.
