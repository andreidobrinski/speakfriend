# Contributing

Contributions to _Speak Friend_ are very welcome! Here are some general vibes
for the project:

**Simplicity**

- We want to keep things simple. This particularly involves the amount of tools we
use to build the project.
- The less magic the better: this makes it easier for people to contribute and
  get involved.
- Don't worry about getting it perfect the right way. We can (and will) refactor later!

**Moving Quickly**

- Open source projects are fun, and making this tool useful is a nice idea to
  think about, but we should make sure we _get stuff done_.
- Good is better than perfect. Refactoring is important; but trying to build the
  perfect project will take âˆž time.

**General Code Tips**

- write comments!
- fork the repo to contribute; creating a branch for the issue you are working on;
  - if there is no issue for what you want to fix/change/break, please submit
    one!

**What can I do?**

- If you're looking for a place to start, browse the [github
  issues](https://github.com/speakfriend/speakfriend/issues)
- consider reading the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) to figure out where we're at on
  the project.
