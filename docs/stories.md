# Terminology

Before identifying what our user stories are, we will try and keep an updated list of the teminology used to describe our platform. Sometimes user stories will be broken up by types of user.

**Speaker**: Any person who wants to speak on a topic and is looking for a spot to do so. A "Speaker" is considered a user.

**Topic / Proposal / Submissions**: A speaker's ideas that they are interested in speaking on. Could have varying levels of details.

**Organizer/Organiation**: Any person or group of people who runs events that facilitate speakers / runs "talks". Considered a user.

**Spot** : A window of time in which an organizer would like to have a speaker give a talk.

**Facilitated** : Describes an organization that is able to host / run a speaker's talk.

Main goal: As a speaker I can use `SpeakFriend` to submit a talk/idea that can be considered and be facilitated by relevant organizations.

- As a speaker, I will have a general idea of organizations that have open / upcoming `spots`  
- As a speaker, I can be sure that my information is secure and that my ideas are only shown to organizations based on a specific criteria (example, I only want organizations within `city of x` to be able to see submissions)
  - d: Important, but phase 2
- As a speaker, I can automatically be reminded when I have an upcoming talk.
